    Message Type        Regular Expression                                  Functionality
    ** task -> user **  <<container>>                                       update current display container

    ** user -> task **  [<<ums>>,<<id>>,<<value>>]                          user-side action (e.g. button-click, textbox edit); second field corresponds to the <<id>> of the item that is manipulated by user; <<value>> must be of a type consistent with this item (e.g. for boolean items value must be a boolean)
    ** user -> task **  [<<ums>>,<<id>>,<<userEvent>>]                      user-side event (e.g. load/unload, captured key or mouse event); second field corresponds to the <<id>> of the item that is manipulated by user

    <<container>>       [<<item>>(,<<item>>)*]                              array of item updates/declarations for current container
    <<item>>            <<value>>|{<<property>>(,<<property>>)*}            an item may be declared by value or a set of properties
    <<property>>        "v":<<value>>                                       set item value; i.e., ["hello world"] is just shorthand for [{"v":"hello world"}]
    <<property>>        "id":<<id>>                                         update the item with the specified <<id>> within the current container; if item specified by id doesn't exist, it is appended to the container; root-level display container has no id
    <<property>>        "id":[<<id>>(,<<id>>)*]                             update the item specified by the <<id>> array, where the first <<id>> identifies the item within current container, with the following <<id>>'s specifying its child, that child's child, etc.; e.g. task->user message [{"id":[2,4],"v":null}] would delete the fifth item inside the third container in the display
    <<id>>              <<text>>                                            unique item key; <<id>> text is displayed as item title text (unless "title" optional property is specified, see below); e.g. [{"id":"Name","v":"Bob"},{"id":"Age","v":77}] adds two key:value pairs to the UI -- Name:Bob and Age:77, and [{"id":"Age","v":78}] would change the value for Age from 77 to 78
    <<id>>              <<uint>>                                            item order number within the current container; item numbering in a container begins at 0, thus {"id":0} is the first item in a given container; if <<uint>> is greater or equal to current number of items in the container, corresponding value is appended as the last item in the container
    <<value>>           <<text>>|<<number>>|<<boolean>>|<<container>>       item value may be text, number, boolean (signifying buttons/options), or an array of item updates for a child container
    <<value>>           null                                                value of null removes item from container; e.g., [{"id":0,"v":null}] will remove the first item from the display
    <<ums>>             <<uint>>                                            time in milliseconds since the initiation of user software (e.g. onload event)
    <<text>>            ** see JSON string specification, e.g. http://json.org **
    <<number>>          ** see JSON number specification, e.g. http://json.org **
    <<uint>>            ** integer >= 0 **
    <<boolean>>         (true)|(false)

everything above is core-STAP; all user-side sw must be able to handle the format specified above for simple text+button tasks

==

everything below specifies optional directives that enable more featureful user-interface interactions

    <<taskOption>>      "require":{<<required>>(,<<required>>)*}            should be sent once before task begins; specify which options and option values are required for correctly interpreting current task; if any of the <<required>> items are not implemented yet in the user software, the suggested behavior is to disconnect from task after a polite [<<ums>>,0,{"error":"sorry, <<required>> is not yet implemented on this side"}]
    <<taskOption>>      "error":<<text>>                                    error message to be dumped into user-side error stream
    <<taskOption>>      "template":<<url>>|<<js>>                           likely sent once before task begins (may be ignored by computational agents); custom visualization template for STAP messages (e.g. CSS or JS text or url); Template command may be called multiple times to load multiple parts of a template
    <<taskOption>>      "agent":[<<userInfo>>(,<<userInfo>>)*]              likely sent once before task begins; request information about user-side software; the polite thing for user-side software to do would be to reply to "client" <<taskOption>> with as much information as possible, but task-side code should not be dependent on this; participant replies to this request as such: [<<ums>>,0,{"clientinfo":<<json>>}]; e.g. a response to {"clientinfo":["ip","url","screen","userAgent"]} may be [<<ums>>,0,{"clientinfo":{"ip":"129.84.2.65","url":"http://localhost:8080/stap.html","screen":{"availWidth":1524,"availHeight":900,"width":1600,"height":900,"colorDepth":24,"pixelDepth":24,"availLeft":0,"availTop":0,"orientation":{"angle":0}},"userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/47.0.2526.106 Safari/537.36"}}]
    <<taskOption>>      "task":{"(win)|(loss)|(end)":<<conds>>}             likely sent once before task begins; win, loss, and neutral task-end conditions; suggested user-sw behavior for human participants is to convert <<conds>> into natural language and display as "Instructions"; e.g. {"task":{"win":[[{"id":"Round","v":{">":15}},{"id":["player 1","points"],"v":{">":{"@":"v","id":["player 2","points"]}}}]]}} means that a win condition for current task is that after Round 15 player 1 should have more points than player 2
    <<taskOption>>      "task":{"(good)|(bad)":<<conds>>}                   likely sent once before task begins; goal values (what to seek, what to avoid); suggested user-sw behavior for human participants is to convert <<conds>> into natural language and display as "Instructions"; e.g. {"task":{"good":[{"id":"Feedback","v":"Correct"}]}} means that one of the goals in the current task is to get to the state where the value for the field "Feedback" is "Correct", {"task":{"good":[{"id":"Reward","v":{">":0,"closerTo":1}}]}} means that it's good when Reward is above 0 and the closer it is to 1, the better
    <<conds>>           [<<cond>>|<<condAnd>>(,<<cond>>|<<condAnd>>)*]      <<conds>> list is True if any of the items in it are True
    <<condAnd>>         [<<cond>>(,<<cond>>)*]                              <<condAnd>> list is True if ALL of the items in it are True
    <<cond>>            {"id":<<id>>(,<<optionName>>:<<condVal>>)*}         a condition defines what property value(s) must be met for a given item, as specified by item <<id>>
    <<condVal>>         <<value>>|<<range>>|<<propVal>>
    <<range>>           {(<<comp>>:<<number>>|<<propVal>>)(,<<comp>>:<<number>>|<<propVal>>)*}
    <<comp>>            "<|>|(<=)|(>=)|(!=)|(closerTo)"                     numerical comparisons; <, >, <=, >=, != signify numerical range limits, and "closerTo" is employed to signify that value scales; e.g., {"task":{"good":[{"id":"R","v":{">":0,"closerTo":1}}],"bad":[{"id":"R","v":{"<":0,"closerTo":-1}}]}} signifies that R<0 is bad, the closer to R:-1 the worse, and R>0 is good, the closer to R:1, the better
    <<propVal>>         {"@":<<optionName>>(,"id":<<id>>)?}                 property value; e.g., {"@":"max","id":"Score"} is the maximum value of the Score item; if "id" is unspecified it is presumed to be the same as that in the enclosing statement; e.g., {"task":{"good":[{"id":"Score","v":{"closerTo":{"@":"max"}}}]}} signifies that for the current task, the higher the value of the Score item is (i.e., the closer it is to the value of "max"), the better
    <<userInfo>>        "ip"                                                request client ip address
    <<userInfo>>        "userAgent"                                         request information about user-side software (e.g. webbrowser type/version, AI architecture type/version)
    <<userInfo>>        "url"                                               request client url (relevant when user-side software runs in a webbrowser)
    <<userInfo>>        "screen"                                            find out total user screen size (for human participants this would be different from <<eventType>> 13, which only sends back current <<container>> size)
    <<userEvent>>       {(<<userInfo>>:<<json>>)}                           response to "Agent" <<taskOption>>; e.g. a response to {"Agent":["ip","url","screen","userAgent"]} may be a series of messages, such as [<<ums>>,0,{"ip":"129.84.2.65"}] [<<ums>>,0,{"url":"http://localhost:8080/stap.html"}] [<<ums>>,0,{"screen":{"availWidth":1524,"availHeight":900,"width":1600,"height":900,"colorDepth":24,"pixelDepth":24,"availLeft":0,"availTop":0,"orientation":{"angle":0}}}] [<<ums>>,0,{"userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/47.0.2526.106 Safari/537.36"}]
    <<userEvent>>       {"error":<<text>>}                                  user->task messages that contain this directive are dumped into task-side error stream
    <<userEvent>>       [0]                                                 load event to indicate that user-side sw is ready
    <<json>>            ** see full JSON specification, e.g. http://json.org **
    <<url>>             ** legal url **
    <<js>>              ** legal javascript **
    <<html>>            ** legal text/html **


everything above is core-STAP; although task-options can be ignored in many cases, user-side sw must still expect them as potentially incoming messages, and be willing to quit if it cannot handle any of the items specified via the "require" task option

==

everything below can be negotiated via the "require" <<taskOption>>; if task requires options that user sw cannot handle, user software can disconnect

- if a <<property>> is specified for a container (or a container-type, such as table or popup), and it is not applicable to containers, this <<property>> is inherited by all decendent elements; e.g. [{"id":"my container","v":[1,2,{"id":"more","v":[3,4]}],"rnd":1}] signifies that all numeric values in the container "my container", including those in the "more" container, are rounded to 1 (integers)

    Label Name          Regular Expression                                  Functionality
    <<required>>        "options":[<<optionName>>(,<<optionName>>)*]        specify options necessary for this task; e.g., {"required":{"options":["r","rot"]}}
    <<required>>        <<optionName>>:[<<optionVal>>(,<<optionVal>>)*]     specify option values necessary for this task; e.g., {"required":{"select":[1,2,"n"],"type":["table","path"]}}
    <<required>>        "e":[<<eventType>>(,<<eventType>>)*]                specify event types necessary for this task; e.g., {"required":{"e":[40,44]}}
    <<required>>        "path":[<<curveType>>(,<<curveType>>)*]             specify path curve options necessary for this task; e.g., {"required":{"path":["S","C"]}}
    <<required>>        "colors":<<uint>>                                   specify how many different preset colors are necessary for this task; <<uint>> must be greater than 1 (presets 0 and 1 are default background and text colors); e.g., {"required":{"colors":3}} signifies that the task will require 2 different colors in addition to the background and text colors
    <<required>>        "sizeUnits":["<<sizeUnit>>"(,"<<sizeUnit>>")*]      specify size-units necessary for this task; e.g., {"required":{"sizeUnits":["%","E","vh","vw"]}}
    <<required>>        "emphases":{<<emp>>:<<uint>>(,<<emp>>:<<uint>>)*}   specify emphasis types necessary for this task; e.g., {"required":{"emphases":{"emp":3,"emp2":3}}} signifies that two emphases types are required (emp and emp2), each with three levels of strength
    <<emp>>             ** text string starting with "emp"; e.g. "emp2" **
    <<curveType>>       ** the string on the leftmost part of <<pathTo>> expression; i.e., character C, S, Q, T, or A **
    <<optionName>>      ** the part to the left of the colon in the <<property>> or <<taskOption>> expression; e.g. "S", "eB", "bg" **
    <<optionVal>>       ** the part to the right of the colon in the <<property>> or <<taskOption>> expression **

    <<taskOption>>      <<property>>                                        optional properties for display container

    <<property>>        <<optionName>>:null                                 remove/reset property (i.e. clear or reset to default behavior)
    <<property>>        <<command>>                                         commands that alter how other properties are changed; <<command>> property values are not permanent; e.g. [{"id":"x","T":10,"bg":"blue"}] signifies that the background of "x" should be changed to blue over the course of 10seconds, after which the value of "bg" (background) remains "blue", but the value "T" (time of animation) resets to null, because "T" is an <<command>> option
    <<property>>        <<option>>                                          generic options
    <<property>>        <<inputOption>>                                     user-input options (specify whether item value is editable, and what the behavior is upon edits)
    <<property>>        <<boolOption>>                                      boolean item options
    <<property>>        <<numOption>>                                       number item options
    <<property>>        <<txtOption>>                                       text item options
    <<property>>        <<aniOption>>                                       animation options

    <<command>>         "$":<<searchTerm>>                                  select items; apply current updates to all of the items that match <<searchTerm>>; e.g. [{"id":"x","v":"hello"},{"id":"z","v":[{"id":"y","v":[{"id":"x","v":"goodbye"}]}]}] followed by {"$":["y","x"],"bg":"red"} would turn the background of "x"-"hello" and "x"-"goodbye" id-value pairs red
    <<command>>         "$":[<<searchTerm>>(,<<searchTerm>>)*]              multiple selects; apply current updates to all of the items that match any one <<searchTerm>>
    <<command>>         "O":1                                               Onedit/onsubedit trigger for current update (i.e. pretend as if there was a user-side input); useful for playback, demo, instructions; e.g. task->user messages [{"id":"press me","v":false,"onedit":null}] [{"id":"press me","v":true,"O":1}] would add a button, one that would disappear once clicked, and then force-click the button, causing it to disappear
    <<command>>         "P":<<id>>                                          Push (i.e. insert) current item before item specified by <<id>> in current container; e.g. ["a","b","c"] followed by [{"v":"x","P":1}] is equivalent to ["a","x","b","c"]
    <<command>>         "P":[<<uint>>,<<uint>>]                             Push with replace; insert current item in place of range specified by [<<uint>>,<<uint>>] (i.e. insert and remove all items between the two integers, including the first and disincluding the last, in current container); e.g. ["a","b","c"] followed by [{"v":"x","P":[1,2]}] is equivalent to ["a","x","c"]
    <<command>>         "Q":<<number>>|<<text>>                             Queue identifier (Qid) for current update; useful for identifying and resetting updates; receipts for edits with Q would include a Qid in place of item <<id>>; updates animated via S command that also include a Qid are immediately stopped next time an update is sent with the same Qid reference; updates delayed via T or U commands that also include a Qid are removed from queue next time an update is sent with the same Qid reference; e.g. the following two task->user message -- [{"id":"candles","v":0},{"id":"candles","v":1,"Q":"t1","U":10000,"R":1},{"id":"candles","v":2,"Q":"t2","U":20000,"R":1}] -- would result in a key:value pair "candles":0 being added to display, and timers set up to change the value of "candles" to 1 at 10sec, then to 2 at 20sec into the task, and a follow-up message {"Q":"t1"} would remove the update scheduled to occur at 10sec, resulting in a single receipt message sent by user sw at 20s into the task -- [20000,"t2",[1]]
    <<command>>         "R":1|2|3                                           Receipt request for current update; 1 indicates a receipt is required when property change(s) begin -- user->task message: [<<ums>>,<<id>>,[1]]; 2 indicates a receipt is required when property change(s) end, after animation (if the property changes are not animated, "R":2 flag is ignored) -- user->task message: [<<ums>>,<<id>>,[1]]; "R":3 indicates that receipts [1] and [2] are both requested; e.g. {"bg":"blue","U":5000,"S":5,"R":3,"Q":"aniblue"} indicates that the background should take 5 seconds to become blue, starting at user-time 5000 (i.e. 5s into the task), and reciept events should be sent to task at beginning and end of animation with "aniblue" as the id -- this will result in the following messages sent back to task software: [5000,"aniblue",[1]] and [10000,"aniblue",[2]]
    <<command>>         "S":<<number>>                                      Seconds to make current update (i.e. animation); <<number>> is the number of seconds over which current update takes place
    <<command>>         "T":<<number>>                                      Timeout (i.e. delay) for current update (exclusive with "U" command); <<number>> is the number of seconds to delay; e.g. {"v":null,"T":2} will clear the screen after a 2 seconds timout; [{"id":"text","v":"hello"},{"id":"text","v":null,"T":2}}] would add "text":"hello" to screen, and then remove it 2 seconds later
    <<command>>         "U":<<ums>>                                         User-time for current update (exclusive with "T" command); used to delay the processing of the current update until user time has reached specified <<ums>>

    <<searchTerm>>      <<id>>|<<tag>>                                      match by <<id>> or <<tag>>; search is recursive, not just in current container; empty-string matches items where id isn't specified (e.g., {"$":"","bg":"red"} sets background of all items without an id to red); e.g., {"$":"x","bg":"red"} would find all items where id is "x" or one of the tags (specified via "#") is "x" and set their background colors to "red"
    <<searchTerm>>      {<<searchProp>>(,<<searchProp>>)*}                  match by property values; if no <<searchProp>> is specified, all items are selected (e.g., {"$":{},"c":"red"} sets color of all text of all items to "red")
    <<searchProp>>      "recur":0                                           recursive search flag; property searches are recursive by default, add "recur":0 to search only current container, not child containers; e.g., {"$":{"recur":0},"c":"red"} sets color of all text of all items in current container to "red"
    <<searchProp>>      <<property>>                                        match by property values; all <<property>> values must match; selection by "type" property is allowed for items with both explicit and derived types (e.g., {"$":{"type":0},"v":0} would set all numeric values to 0's); selection by "#" property searches for whether the specified hashtag exists (e.g.; {"$":{"#":"xx"},"c":"red"} finds all elements where one of the hashtags is "xx" and sets text color to red); e.g., {"$":{"v":1},"v":0} would set all 1's to 0's, [{"id":"my container","v":[{"$":{"type":[]},"bg":"blue"}]}] will set backgrounds of all containers inside of "my container" to blue

    <<property>>        "type":<<itemType>>                                 the value specified for this item 
    <<itemType>>        "popup"                                             this item is a popup -- a special <<container>> that pops up over other items of the parent container, partially obscuring their view, and preventing them from being edited

    <<inputOption>>     "onedit":<<item>>                                   how to change editable item after user changes its value; use "onedit":{} to reset a control to do nothing after a user-directed change; e.g. [{"id":"say something:","v":"","eT":1,"onedit":""}] will create a textbox where user can type something, but as soon as they hit Enter, the text will disappear; [{"id":"btn1","v":false,"onedit":{"eB":0}}] creates a button, btn1, that becomes disabled once clicked; [{"id":"btn1","v":false,"onedit":null}] creates a button, btn1, that gets removed once clicked
    <<inputOption>>     "onsubedit":<<item>>                                how to change container after one of its descendant items receives user input; e.g. [{"id":"choose","v":[{"id":"choice 1","v":false},{"id":"choice 2","v":false},{"id":"choice 3","v":false}],"select":1,"onsubedit":{"eB:0"}}] creates a set of three choices, which all become disabled once any one of them gets clicked

    <<boolOption>>      "select":-1|0|1|2                                   selection behavior for boolean items: -1 (default) means that each item is selected (true) on click, and considered deselected immediately (i.e. clickable buttons); 0 means that each item is selected (true) on mousedown, and deselected (false) on mouseup (i.e. hold-down buttons); 1 means that an item stays selected (true) when clicked, until it is clicked again to deselect (false), or until another item is selected within the current container (i.e. radio buttons or select); 2 means that each item is selected (true) when clicked and deselected (false) when clicked again (i.e. checkboxes or multiple-select)
    <<boolOption>>      "select":"n"                                        selection behavior for boolean items: "n" is a hybrid between 1 and 0 -- only one item in container can be selected at a time, but the selection/deselection does not happen on click, but rather on mousedown/hover/mouseup  (e.g. a set of navigation buttons) -- each item is selected (true) either on mousedown or on mousehover while another boolean item in this container is selected, and an item is deselected (false) either on mouseup or when mouse hovers over some other boolean item in this container

    <<numOption>>       "rnd":<<number>>                                    round to the nearest <<number>>; e.g. [{"id":"x","v":57.1,"rnd":.01}] should be interpreted as x=57.10, [{"id":"x","v":57.1,"rnd":5}] should be interpreted as x=55

    <<numOption>>       "time":"(<<timeField>>)+"                           exclusive with "unit" option; indicates that the value for this item is the total number of seconds since 1970/01/01 00:00; e.g. [{"id":"when","v":1483963200,"time":"YMDhm"}] is a way to specify date/time 2017/01/09 12:00; [{"v":543.21,"time":"ms."}] is a way to specify 9:03.210 (9min, 3sec, 210ms)

    <<txtOption>>       "chmax":<<number>>                                  max number of characters in <<text>>
    <<txtOption>>       "mask":{<<regex>>:<<text>>(,<<regex>>:<<text>>)*}   replace <<regex>> with <<text>> throughout the string (global replace); e.g. [{"v":"","eT":1,"mask":{".","*"}}] would add a text input field where each character would be masked by "*" (like in password fields)

    <<aniOption>>       "ease":(0|1|2|3|4|"back"|"elastic"|"bounce")        easing option for animation; 0 (default) is linear animation, 1 is quadratic, 2 is cubic, 3 is quart, 4 is quint, "back" overshoots and comes back, "elastic" overshoots and undershoots a few times before settling at required value, "bounce" bounces off the desired value and then gravitates to it again and bounces again a few times; see http://greensock.com/ease-visualizer to visualize ease options
    <<aniOption>>       "easeout":(1|-1|0)                                  ease direction; 1 (default) eases the end of the animation, -1 eases the start of the animation, 0 eases on both ends of the animation; see http://greensock.com/ease-visualizer to visualize ease options

    <<tableOption>>     "head":0|1                                          if this value is 1, first row of a table is treated as the header row (default value is 0)

    <<pieOption>>       "bounda":[<<number>>(,<<number>>)*]                 bounding angles of the pie in clockwise order, 0 degrees is up; e.g., [{"id":"navigation","v":[{"id":"E","v":false},{"id":"S","v":false},{"id":"W","v":false},{"id":"N","v":false}],"type":"pie","bounda":[45,135,225,315]}] creates a 4-button east-south-west-north pie
