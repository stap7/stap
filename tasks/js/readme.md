JavaScript is a versatile language for developing STAP tasks.

This is because JavaScript task code may run

* in the web-browser (for human participants, interpreted via stap.js or similar library)

* as a standalone console app (may be piped to agent software running on the same machine, or served for agents over TCP)

* as a node.js module (may interact with a JS agent via shared memory)
