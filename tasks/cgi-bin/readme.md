This folder includes CGI (common gateway interface) scripts meant to be consumed via a STAP client (e.g. stapjs, actr-stap).

What is CGI?
* CGI scripts are stateless applications, and probably constitute the most common method of web-app development. Stateless applications assume that your script will be getting "hit" with a different URL (or POSTed data) to inform the script as to the current state of the given task.

The included scripts provide examples of json, as well as jsonp responses.
